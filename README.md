# Darkyenus Time Tracker
*for IntelliJ (and other Jetbrains IDEs)*

Simple and lightweight plugin for tracking of time spent on project.

Adds a single status bar widget: click or type to start counting, click again to stop.
Pauses the timer automatically when idle.
Time is saved in IDE's workspace files, does not clutter project's directory.
Can inject time to git commits.
