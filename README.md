# Darkyenus Time Tracker
*for IntelliJ (and other Jetbrains IDEs)*

Simple and lightweight plugin for tracking of time spent on project.

Adds a single status bar widget: click or type to start counting, click again to stop.
Pauses the timer automatically when idle (after two minutes of inactivity).
Time is saved in IDE's workspace files, does not clutter project's directory.

### Installing
Download `.jar` directly from GitHub releases or from plguin repository (TBD, approval pending).

### Building from source
There are no dependencies, this is a pure IntelliJ plugin. PR's are welcome!
